# SOC-Analysis

**SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst**. The project is designed to simulate a real-world scenario and help you gain practical experience in monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity threats.

---

### **Project Title:**  
**Cybersecurity Threat Detection and Incident Response Simulation**

---

### **Objective:**  
To set up a SOC environment for monitoring network traffic, identifying potential security incidents, analyzing threats, and responding to cybersecurity events in real-time.

---

### **Project Scope:**  
- Build a basic SOC environment using open-source tools.
- Simulate and detect various types of cyber-attacks.
- Perform threat analysis and mitigation steps.
- Create incident reports and provide recommendations for future prevention.

---

### **Tools & Technologies:**
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):**  
  - Use **Splunk** or **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** to collect, analyze, and correlate log data.
- **IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention System):**  
  - Use **Snort** or **Suricata** to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  
  - Use **OSSEC** or **Wazuh** for endpoint security monitoring.
- **Packet Analyzer:**  
  - Use **Wireshark** to capture and analyze network traffic.
- **Threat Intelligence Platform:**  
  - Use **AlienVault OTX** or **Cortex XSOAR** for threat intelligence and automated response workflows.
- **Kali Linux (Attacker Machine):**  
  - Use **Kali Linux** for simulating attacks like port scanning, DDoS, and phishing.

---

### **Project Steps:**

---

### **1. Set Up the SOC Environment**
- **Configure SIEM (Splunk/ELK):**  
  Install and configure your SIEM tool to collect logs from various sources, including firewalls, web servers, and endpoints.
  
- **Set Up IDS/IPS (Snort/Suricata):**  
  Deploy Snort or Suricata to monitor network traffic and generate alerts for abnormal behavior.
  
- **Install EDR (OSSEC/Wazuh):**  
  Deploy OSSEC or Wazuh to monitor endpoints (laptops, servers) for suspicious activities, file changes, or unauthorized access.

---

### **2. Generate and Collect Logs**
- Simulate real-time traffic on your network using tools like **Tcpreplay** to replay network traffic captures.
- Ensure that logs are being generated and sent to your SIEM from all endpoints, firewalls, and network devices.

---

### **3. Simulate Cyber-Attacks**
Perform several types of attacks from an attacker machine (Kali Linux):
- **Port Scanning:**  
  Use **Nmap** to scan the network for open ports and services.
- **Brute Force Attack:**  
  Use **Hydra** or **Medusa** to perform brute force attacks on SSH or web logins.
- **Phishing Simulation:**  
  Use **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)** to simulate a phishing attack.
- **DDoS Attack:**  
  Simulate a basic DDoS attack using **Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC)** or **Hping3**.

---

### **4. Monitor and Detect Security Incidents**
- **Monitor SIEM:**  
  Track events and alerts generated from your SIEM. Identify suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts, large data transfers, or traffic spikes.
  
- **Analyze IDS/IPS Alerts:**  
  Investigate any alerts generated by your IDS/IPS, such as suspicious traffic patterns or port scans.
  
- **Endpoint Monitoring:**  
  Use your EDR system to detect any changes on endpoints, such as unauthorized file modifications or malware installations.

---

### **5. Perform Threat Analysis**
- **Investigate Alerts:**  
  Use the information from your SIEM, IDS, and EDR tools to investigate the alerts and analyze the severity of the threat.
  
- **Capture and Analyze Network Traffic (Wireshark):**  
  Capture network traffic to examine the details of malicious activities like phishing or data exfiltration.

- **Threat Intelligence Correlation:**  
  Use **AlienVault OTX** or another threat intelligence platform to correlate detected threats with known indicators of compromise (IoCs).

---

### **6. Incident Response**
- **Contain the Threat:**  
  Based on your analysis, initiate the incident response process. This could involve isolating infected endpoints, blocking IP addresses, or disabling compromised accounts.
  
- **Eradicate and Recover:**  
  Remove malicious software, restore affected systems from clean backups, and apply patches where necessary.
  
- **Document the Incident:**  
  Create an incident report that outlines the attack, the detection process, actions taken, and preventive recommendations.

---

### **7. Post-Incident Reporting & Review**
- **Create a Detailed Report:**  
  Summarize the incident, including the type of attack, systems affected, how it was detected, and the steps taken to resolve it. Include evidence from logs, packet captures, and threat intelligence reports.
  
- **Lessons Learned & Recommendations:**  
  Conduct a post-incident analysis to determine how the threat could have been prevented and recommend steps for strengthening defenses (e.g., better firewall rules, enhanced user training).

---

### **Expected Outcome:**
- A functioning SOC environment with real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities.
- Practical experience in detecting and responding to different cyber-attacks.
- An incident report detailing the detection, analysis, and remediation of a security incident.
- Enhanced skills in working with SIEM, IDS/IPS, and threat intelligence tools, and a strong understanding of the incident response process.

---

### **Bonus Challenge:**
Integrate automated response workflows (e.g., using **SOAR tools** like **Cortex XSOAR** or **Splunk Phantom**) to automate repetitive tasks such as blocking malicious IP addresses or isolating compromised endpoints.

This project will give you hands-on experience in threat detection, incident response, and using industry-standard security toolsâ€”essential skills for a SOC Analyst.
